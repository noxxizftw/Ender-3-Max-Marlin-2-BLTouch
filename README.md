# Ender-3-Max-Marlin-2-BLTouch
Ive had a hard time finding a Pre-Built Ender 3 Max BLTouch Enabled Marlin 2 Build. So i decide to take the time out to build one myself. If you decide to use the provided firmware.Your choosing to do so at your own risk. I personally havent had any issues myself, since uploading this firmware to my Ender 3 Max.
